Then scale each row to have variance one.\n\nNote that after the inverse normal transformation, each row has mean zero and identical variance (if we use ordinal ranking). Hence rescaling can be done once on the whole matrix.\n\nThe formula and default value for the paramater c come from this paper: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2921808/\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"}]
