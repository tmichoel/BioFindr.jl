This framework assumes that the real distribution of a certain test statistic forms a mixture distribution of null and alternative hypotheses. After estimating the null distribution, either analytically or by simulation, it can be compared against the real distribution to determine the proportion of null hypotheses, and consequently the posterior probability that the alternative hypothesis is true at any value of the statistic.","category":"page"},{"location":"posteriorprobs/","page":"Bayesian inference of posterior probabilities","title":"Bayesian inference of posterior probabilities","text":"[Chen2007]: Chen L, Emmert-Streib F, Storey J.
